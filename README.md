## Motivation

There are lots of libraries that provide keyboard shortcuts for web apps, but most of them are somewhat heavy and depend on extra dependencies. I wanted to create a simple and lightweight package that provided this functionality without any dependencies and made with vanilla JS, so it could be integrated into any web project.

## Installation

You can install hotkeypad via npm, pnpm or yarn. Here's how you can do it with npm:

```bash
npm install hotkeypad
```

## Usage

To use HotKeyPad, you need to import the package and create a new instance of the HotKeyPad class. You can then add commands to the keypad and display it on your web app.

First, add thee following tag to your page:
```html
<div id="hotkeypad"></div>
```

Then, you can use the following code to add the keypad to your page:
```javascript
import HotKeyPad from 'hotkeypad'

const hotkeypad = new HotKeyPad()

// This will set the commands and render the keypad automatically
hotkeypad.setCommands([
  {
    section: "Actions",
    id: "print",
    title: "Print Page",
    icon: `#custom-icon-print#`, // You can insert your own icon here, being and svg, image or font icon
    hotkey: `${hotKeyPad.activationKey} + P`, // You can use the default activation key or set your own
    handler: () => {
      window.print()
    }
  },
])

// You can also add a listener to the open and close events
window.addEventListener('hotkeypad:open', () => {
  console.log('HotKeyPad is open')
})

window.addEventListener('hotkeypad:close', () => {
  console.log('HotKeyPad is closed')
})
```
The default activation key is `Ctrl` for Windows/Linux and `Cmd` for Mac.
